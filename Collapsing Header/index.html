            <p>The Gudovac massacre was the killing of around 190 Serb civilians by the Croatian nationalist Ustaše movement on 28 April 1941, during World War II. It occurred shortly after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and the establishment of the Ustaše-led puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia. It was the first Ustaše massacre of Serb civilians and presaged a wider genocide against them that would last until the end of the war. The Ustaše used the deaths of two of their local followers as a pretext for the killings. The victims were drawn from the Gudovac district, taken to a nearby field and shot en masse. Five survived the initial shooting and crawled away. The victims were then buried in a mass grave. The Germans soon became aware of the killing and dug up some of the bodies; they arrested 40 suspects, who were released following the intervention of a senior Ustaše official. Monuments were erected on the site of the massacre in 1955, but destroyed by Croatian nationalists in 1991, amid inter-ethnic warfare. A restored monument was unveiled at the site in December 2010.</p>
