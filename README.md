# Hover Effect

Suppose you define a div container and gave it an id as "alpha"
```
alpha{
  background-image = url("space-picture.jpg");
}
```

To apply hover effect on this you just have to add colon and hover keyword

```
alpha:hover {
  background-image = url("pool-picture.jpg");
}
```

So now when you take your mouse at space-picture.jpg it will change to pool-picture.jpg image.
